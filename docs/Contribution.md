## Style Guide for Git Commit Messages :memo:

- Use the imperative mood. (Example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

- Create an issue before you make a Pull Request

- Creating pull requests without issue assignment will not be accepted and will be closed.

After this, the project maintainers will review the changes and will merge your PR if they found it good, otherwise we will suggest the required changes.
